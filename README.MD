Adventure, a text-based interactive story between 3 characters (a knight, a mage, and a thief). 

Key Classes:
 * GameCharacter - Abstract class for all characters
 * Knight class - Handles the Knights stats
 * Mage class - Handles the Mages stats
 * Thief class - Handles the Thiefs stats
 * Story class - Handles events and storyline
 * Adventure class - Main method class

Characters will have different traits and different stats, some will be better at handling certain situations than other characters. 

As the story progresses towards their goal, some events will take place that will require the user to pick a character to handle the situation, depending on the character and on a little bit of random chaos, there can be good outcomes, neutral outcomes, and bad outcomes. So choose wisely.

The story will consist of 15-20 different situations, some are group events that will either help or harm all the characters, others will be sole events--affecting only one character either by the users choice or by random.

Most events will be important to the characters success. Bad choices will harm the characters and if enough damage is dealt, characters can die and their story will end. All events will be completed and at the end the characters stats will be read, noting how successful the adventure was. Alive characters will guarantee a successful adventure.
